We built our application to let the user search for their favourite movies and TV-shows. The user can get information about the movie, like the release date, movie summary and rate. :cinema:

<br>
We used API, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, HTML5 technologies to build our app<br>

<br>
Some of the challenges we encountered are, finding the API key, finding the image URL and refactoring our code.

<br>
If we were going to continue working on this application, we would add a trailer to the movie, and more search options, like searching for actors.
